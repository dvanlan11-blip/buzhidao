# MOF Screening Program

## Introduction
The MOF Screening Program is focused on the identification and evaluation of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) for various applications including gas storage, separation, and catalysis.

## Objectives
- To screen and identify promising MOFs for targeted applications.
- To provide a centralized database of MOF properties and performance data.

## Methodology
1. **Material Selection:** Select a diverse set of MOFs based on literature and databases.
2. **Characterization:** Characterize physical and chemical properties of selected MOFs.
3. **Performance Testing:** Assess the performance of MOFs in specific applications.
4. **Data Analysis:** Analyze data to identify trends and correlations.

## Conclusion
The MOF Screening Program aims to facilitate research and development in the field of MOFs by providing a robust framework for screening and evaluation.
